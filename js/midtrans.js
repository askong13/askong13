    PRODUCTION WORKFLOW:
    1. A request would be sent to a secure backend (like a Cloud Function).
    2. The backend would use the Midtrans Server Key to create a transaction token.
    3. The token would be returned to the client.
    4. window.snap.pay(TOKEN) would be called.
    
    For now, booking for ${firstName} with ID ${orderId} is recorded.
    Payment would proceed via Midtrans.
